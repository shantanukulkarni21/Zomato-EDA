# Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato.csv Dataset

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato.csv dataset. The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the Zomato.csv dataset using various data visualization techniques and statistical analysis.

## Dataset
The Zomato.csv dataset contains information about the restaurants on the zomato platform across the globe. The dataset includes 9551 rows and 21 columns, with information about the restaurant name, location, ratings, reviews, and more.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

## Usage
To run the EDA, simply run the Zomato EDA.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab environment. The notebook contains the code used to explore and analyze the dataset, along with explanations and visualizations of the results.

## Results
The EDA on the Zomato.csv dataset reveals several interesting insights about the restaurants on Zomato, including:
1. Zomato is most widely used in India, followed by the USA and UK
2. Most of the people using zomato have not given any rating for the restaurants. 
3. The average rating out of five is between 2.5 to 3.4
4. Online deliveries are available in UAE and India
